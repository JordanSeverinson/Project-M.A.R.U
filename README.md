# Project M.A.R.U
Senior design project
Our project is an autonomous Robo-Car thatâ€™s designed to navigate a variety of competitive scenarios. It will use a variety of sensors to detect a block or another Robo-car and push it out of a sumo ring while avoiding the boundary of the ring. The Robo-Car will traverse a designated course without human intervention. This is important because robotics is a branch of engineering that combines aspects such as hardware, sensors, and programming which serves as a way to further develop engineering and problem-solving skills.
